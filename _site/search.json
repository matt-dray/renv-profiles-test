How do you deal with that in the context of a blog built with R?\nThe sole purpose of this {distill} blog is to test whether {renv} might be a viable solution for reproducibility on a post-by-post basis.\n{renv} typically works on the scale of a whole project, but since version 0.13.0 you can have multiple profiles within a given project.\nI think this means that each post can have its own profile with its own distinct set of packages and package versions.\nThat means you can easily recreate the specific package environment for a given post if you need to alter and re-render it in future.\nExample\nThere are two posts on this blog. They both use the {dplyr} package, but one depends on an old version (0.8.5) and one depends on the current version (1.0.8).\nUsing {renv} profiles means that these package versions don’t interfere with each other.\nThe post depending on the older {dplyr} version can’t access across(), but the post depending on the newer {dplyr} version can use across(). The environments associated with the profiles for each post are totally isolated from each other.\nHow\nAfter creating your blog with distill::create_blog(), building it and initiating a reproducible environment with renv::init(), a new-post workflow could look like this:\nCreate a new post with distill_create_post()\nActivate a profile for the new post with renv::activate(), providing a unique name to the profile argument (I suggest the post’s folder name as seen in the blog’s _posts/ folder)\nInstall the packages you need for the post with renv::install()\nCapture the dependencies in the profile’s lockfile with renv::snapshot()\nYou can return to the default {renv} profile for the blog as a whole with renv::activate(profile = NULL). This is the profile for when you first ran renv::init().\n\n\n\n",
